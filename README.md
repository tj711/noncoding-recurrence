# Noncoding Mutation Recurrence Prediction

This project is about exploration of regression models for noncoding mutation recurrence in cancer, aiming at finding a most accurate regression model for noncoding mutation recurrence prediction so that based on the predicted recurrences, we can rank the noncoding mutations by their recurrences from high to low, and then choose the top N mutations as cancer driver mutation candidates and then identify through biological experiment validations.
